 ***Post MVP***
 -menu with instructions, feedback, ratings,
 -initial instructions
 -add comments
 -maybe just do recommended based off all shows, and filter out dupes.
 -watched, to watch.
 -your rating, with ability to submit rating.
 -simple animations
 -improve the picker on discover. Maybe put 'Favorite Shows' on left
 -Look at similar apps for ideas! (There are a lot out there)
 -Polish ( neumorphism)
 -make font bigger, especially in detail view
 -add sort to the lists, so no image availables go to bottom (should i filter those out altogether?).
 -more pages in results
 -add other ways to sort
 -progress bar
 -news updates
 have related shows in detail page, rather than needing user to save show.
 -custom alerts / on-off
 -to watch list
 -BGRefresh doesnt get triggered in low battery mode.
 -sort favorites by active
 -if there are 2 new air dates when the app comes into foreground, only 1 alert is shown. not a big deal, but not ideal.
 -i probably need to add a property to each show, like notificationSet = true for the edge case when the user saves a show, but notifications are disabled. Or maybe the workaround is to not save the ep 1 show, so if the user does enable notifications the BG/Foreground check will catch it.
 -add !notificationManager.check to views other than myfavs (this is the notification authorization check)

 
 ***QUESTIONS***
 -Why does navigationlink load detailview for each item in list?
