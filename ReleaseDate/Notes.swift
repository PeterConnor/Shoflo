 ***BUGS***
 -navigation link does work if you go to detailview and back, unless u search first and then hit nav link and back.
 
 ***To Do***
 -Need to remove list row and make it its own view
 -Add ratings and other relevant properties to datasearch, and then to searchview, and ultimately to detail view.
 -Allow user to save detailview 
 -Add image to searchview results?
 
 ***APP FLOW / IDEAS ***
 Search -> DetailView -> Add to ListView and set notifications
 ListView -> DetailView -> set/edit notifications
 Discover, based on user's saved shows
