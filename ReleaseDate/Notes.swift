 ***BUGS***
 -navigation link does work if you go to detailview and back, unless u search first and then hit nav link and back. Might need to update.
 -Try Image with ForEach
 
 ***To Do***
 -need to replace [0] with index in search view for loop
 -need to make sure list in search view displays some kind of N/A image, when the getImage func can't append one to imageList
 
 -i dont think discover recommended works correctly after deleting something from favorites because myshows is already initialized with the core data, but not updated after the delete. the core data is update, but not myshows in discoverview. (i think) A good way to test is to have multiple shows in a row.
 -make my favorites go to detail and make discover view go to detail.
 -notifications. how are these going to look?
 -Discover - for recommended, Need to pass through id of favorited shows from core data list.
 -delete network manager file?
 Segmented Control with 3 options:
 -For recommendations, it currently checks against favorited shows. Should user be able to search for a show, and then have results pop up based on that show?
-need to run code in background for shows that have null next episode date.

 -Need to remove list row and make it its own view
 -Add image to searchview results, eventually =/
 -adding image to favborites view should be diff

 ***QUESTIONS***
 -what's the difference between list and forEach? (can't manipulate each item in list?). DOES IMAGE WORK WITH FOREACH?
 Why does navigationlink load detailview for each item in list?
