 Did this work???
 
 ***BUGS***
 -navigation link doesn't work if you go to detailview and back, unless u search first and then hit nav link and back. Might need to update.
 
 ***To Do***
 -put each detail vertical stack in its own hstack with spacers on either side.
 -push to remote
 -add saved alert
 -add sort to the lists, so no image availables go to bottom (should i filter those out altogether?).
 -notifications. how are these going to look?
 -need to run code in background for shows that have null next episode date.

 ***QUESTIONS***

 -what's the difference between list and forEach? (can't manipulate each item in list?). DOES IMAGE WORK WITH FOREACH?

 -difference between global async vs main async
